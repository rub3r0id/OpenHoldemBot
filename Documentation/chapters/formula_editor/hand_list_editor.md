# Handlist Editor

OpenHoldem supports hand-lists, mainly for preflop decisions. Creating a
new handlist works basically the same way like creating a new formula.
Select the category “Hand Lists”, then press the button with the blank
sheet and a dialog will pop up that asks you for the name of your list.
All names are allowed as long as they start with the prefix “list”.
Choose a name, press “OK” and the list has been created; empty for the
moment.

To edit your newly created list select it in the tree-view and click the
matrix-button in the toolbar. A dialog will pop up that allows you to
choose the hands in the lists. Pairs are at the main diagonal, Suited
hands above and offsuited hands below.
