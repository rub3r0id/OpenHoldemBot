# f\$test

In addition to the debug-tab there is a special function named
*f\$test.* While f\$debug is meant for a set of multiple expressions
f\$test is for a single large expression, even up to complete multi-line
function text. No equality-sign here. Just enter your code and play
around until you are satisfied with the results.
