# Main Menu

## File

The File menu is pretty self-explaining. It contains some standard
Windows menu items to create a new document and to open and save the
current formula set. Below the sub-menu shows a list of last recently
used formulas which you can select to open. The last menu item finally
will quit OpenHoldem

## Edit

The edit-menu contains the following items:

- *Formula*: this opens the formula-editor which will be explained in a
  separate chapter

- *Preferences*: this opens a dialog with option settings. Again it is
  so manifold that it deserves an extra chapter

- *Tag Log-File*: This will create an entry in the log that makes it
  easy to find and review critical situations.

      [*** ATTENTION ***] User tagged this situation for review

  If the autoplayer already acted this log-message will appear slightly
  after the interesting decision.

- *View Log-File*: this will open the log-file of this OpenHoldem
  instance. A convenient feature if you have multiple logs in your
  directory.

- *View Scraper Output*: this menu item opens a dialog where you can
  inspect the result of all scraped regions

- *Shoot Replay-Frame*: this final menu-item will shoot a replay-frame,
  be it for the creation of a tablemap or for reviewing the decisions of
  your botlogic. Again replay-frames and the OHreplay application are
  explained in an extra chapter.

## Problem Solver

</figure>

The Problem-Solver is a tool meant to help newbies to get OpenHoldem
running. It will execute certain checks and will output diagnostic
messages and helpful hints. As newbies regularly need help and don’t
know where to get help this feature got a prominent place in the main
menu without being hidden in a sub-menu.

## Help

Finally the Help menu contains five menu items:

- *Help*: this option will display OpenHoldems main manual, i.e. this
  document.

- *OpenPPL Manual*: opens the OpenPPL manual, which historically became
  and still is a separate document. Most people writing bot-logic
  probably don’t need to see the full complexity of OpenHoldem.

- *Forums*: this will open your favourite web-browser and lead you to
  the OpenHoldem forums at
  <a href="www.maxinmontreal.com/forums/index.php"
  class="uri">www.maxinmontreal.com/forums/index.php</a>

- *Problem Solver*: this menu item will start the Problem Solver already
  discussed above

- *About this Program*:
