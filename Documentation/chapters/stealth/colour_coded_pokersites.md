# Pokersites and Security

## Remarks

1.  IPoker, Bovada/Bodog, 888: supported by Shanky Bonusbots. Lots of
    people botting there naked without any stealth and insane
    “human-like” hours. But be careful. Even a bot-friendly site like
    888 will ban you if you play 450 SNG each day like one of our users
    did recently.

2.  Cereus (former Absolute and Ultimate): the scandal casino with the
    worst reputation on earth. Bots welcome.

3.  OnGame: we once knew a guy who ran a farm there, 55 acounts, NL 10
    SSS, singletabling (because his hopper was not able to run more than
    one table), playing all accounts naked round the clock. It took six
    weeks until he got busted.

4.  Winning Network: no bans known

5.  Prima Network: the only ban we ever heard of happened after a long
    holiday (bot turned off).

6.  MicroGaming: occasional bans

7.  CakePoker: quite bot-friendly. They disallow PokerTracker-support
    and have anonymized hand-histories to protect both fish and bots.
    When they got supported by Shanky BonusBots several years ago they
    asked Egor not to advertise that fact in public and get called “Site
    X” there, but hundreds of botters were able to play there naked
    until cake had to be unsupported for technical reasons. However they
    ban OpenHoldem botters (even with basic stealth), maybe because
    these bots are fewer and more sophisticated.

8.  Merge: supported by Shanky in the past until a mass-ban out of the
    blue sky.

9.  Party: supposed to be nearly as strict as PokerStars back in 2006
    when Party got 70% of the Poker market. However reports about bans
    became very rare in the mean-time and more and more people report
    good successes.

10. FullTilt: always considered “yellow” in the early botting-years of
    WinHoldem. Stealth was recommended for users of OpenHoldem /
    WinHoldem, but botting was possible, whereas hundreds of
    Bonusbotters could play naked for several years, just like at Cake.
    Then out of the blue sky FullTilt banned all BonusBotters, Black
    Friday happened, the owners of FullTilt ran away with their
    customers money and PokerStars bought this casino. Strange enough:
    botting at FullTilt is still doable.

11. PokerStars: “red”; always strictly anti-bot. Botting there requires
    sophisticated stealth, though we know several people who bot there,
    each one with a highly individual self-made setup. If you are a
    newbie who runs a bot at PokerStars naked they will warn you once.
    If you try to hide a bot or get caught a second time they will ban
    you and seize all your funds. Botting there is recommended only for
    the brave and very experienced

## Rules of Thumb

- Choose small sites. They usually don’t have the man-power and know-how
  to go for a bot-hunt and they need every customer, including bots that
  provide traffic for the real players.

- Choose large networks. This advice might seem to contradict the first
  one, but large networks usually consist of several (and sometimes
  dozens) of small sites that share the player-pool. Each site is mostly
  interested in its own business; they don’t have much man-power and
  know-how either; and the communication and cooperation between these
  sites is often non-existent.

- Choose sites that are supported by “ready-to-go” poker-bots (i.e.
  Shanky BonusBots, as WinHoldem and OPI are dead and all other
  commercials we know about are plain scams). The reasoning is simple:
  if other people – mostly with limited computer-skills – can run a bot
  naked, then you should be safe too. Exceptions exist, see the list
  above.

- Stay away from large monolithic sites. Simple fact: PokerStars,
  FullTilt and PartyPoker have the man-power and the know-how to go for
  a bot-hunt. They don’t need the traffic nor the rake, but they have
  much to lose in case of a \*\*itstorm on twoplustwo.com. So these
  sites care, some a bit more, some a bit less. Stay away as a beginner.
