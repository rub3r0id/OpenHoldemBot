# OpenHoldem Preferences - Debugging

Debugging preferences control how much and what debug-messages
OpenHoldem writes to the log-file. These options are especially meant
for developers who sometimes need to get very detailed information about
how OpenHoldem internally works when they try to fix a problem or test a
new feature. Therefore we won’t go into detail here. Just have a look
and imagine what happens beyond the surface.
