# OpenHoldem Preferences - Hand History Generator

This preferences tab provides just a single option to enable or disable
the handhistory generator. This option is meant to support poker sites
that don’t store hand histories at your hard drive for session review
and PokerTracker support. If enabled the hand histories can be found in
the directory “OpenHoldem/Hand_Histories/\<SESSION_ID\>/”.
